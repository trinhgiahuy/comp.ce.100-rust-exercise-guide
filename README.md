# Rust Exercise Guide
This is an auxiliary book provided as support material with the Rust exercise on COMP.CE.100. I.e. "How to create, build and run a demo program on PYNQ-Z1 using the command line and Xilinx tools".

## Setup & Reading
To view the contents of the book, you can either read the sources by clicking on the "src/" directory above, or you can read the rendered version on your browser using `mdbook`. `mdbook` can be set up as follows:

1. Install [the Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) unless already installed.
2. Install mdbook: run `cargo install mdbook` on a command line.
3. Serve the book at localhost: run `mdbook serve` in this directory.
4. Navigate to "http://localhost:3000/" on your browser.
