## Register access

Let's get started. Register access in Rust is more complicated than in C. Please refer to the Rust book for the following relevant concepts that will not be explained here: [variable bindings](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/variable_bindings.html), [mutability](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/variable_bindings/mut.html), [constants](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/custom_types/constants.html?highlight=const#constants), [for-loops](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.for.html).


### C

In C, you might declare a macro with an 8-character hexadecimal, representing a 64-bit memory address, that is then cast into a 64-bit pointer to an 8-bit value, like so:

```c
#define ADDRESS (uint8_t*) 0x42010002
```

Then you'd perhaps define a particular combination of bits to help setting a particular bit in the 8-bit register value:

```c
#define A_BIT 0b00000001
```

And finally, you might set the value in the register by first de-referencing, and then using a bitwise OR to set the particular bit:

```c
*ADDRESS |= A_BIT;
```

### Rust

In Rust, you'd first declare the 64-bit address to an 8-bit value and the bit combination as constant globals like so:

```rs
const ADDRESS: *mut u8 = 0x42010002 as *mut u8;
const A_BIT: u8 = 0b00000001;
```

Now's the complicated part. Rust doesn't allow direct register access, and the compiler is more aggressive at optimizing. That's why we must use a set of method designed for register access, called `core::ptr::read_volatile` and `core::ptr::write_volatile`.

First, we must retrieve the 64-bit pointer to the 8-bit value into a **mutable binding**:

```rs
let value: *mut u8 = core::ptr::read_volatile( ADDRESS );
```

Then we must flip the bit, and write back into the register at the end of the 64-bit pointer:

```rs
value |= A_BIT;

// Write `value` back to main memory at `ADDRESS`
core::ptr::write_volatile( ADDRESS, value );
```

For your convenience, we have also provided a method called `mutate_ptr` to help do all of the above in one go:

```rs
const ADDRESS: *mut u8 = 0x42010002 as *mut u8;
const A_BIT: u8 = 0b00000001;

fn some_function() {
    mutate_ptr(ADDRESS, |val| val |= A_BIT);
}
```

Now that you know how to do register access, you might be able to rewrite the `setup` function from C in Rust.
